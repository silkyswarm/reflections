Github can be used to push/pull repositories.
Push will update the cloud repository from the local one.
Pull will update the local one if the cloud one is more updated.
Cloning within Github is called Forking
  Repos forked from get recognition in terms of a +1 on their forking counter.
  From a forked repository, local cloning can be made by different users and collaborative work can take place.
